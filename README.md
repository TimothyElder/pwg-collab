# pwg-collab

This repo has some files that we are going to be collaborating on. You will need to run `git clone https://github.com/TimothyElder/pwg-collab.git` to get these files on your local computer. Then you will want to add a file yourself using a text editor or `vim`. Then `git add` that file before running `git commit` and `git push`. 

There could be version conflicts if someone else has pushed commits that you don't have so good practice is to `git fetch` before doing your work. `git pull` gets any changes that might have occurred in the remote repository you don't currently have. 

So always run: 

1. `git fetch` 
2. `git add`
3. `git commit`
4. `git push` 

in that order.
